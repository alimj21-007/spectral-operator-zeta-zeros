# Overview â€” Spectral Operators and Zeta Zeros

This project explores the deep connection between spectral operators and the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. It is part of a broader research program led by Ali, focused on reproducible, bilingual, and publicly accessible mathematical analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Construct a self-adjoint operator over a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
- Compute its eigenvalues numerically using high-precision solvers.
- Compare the spectrum with the imaginary parts of zeta zeros using statistical and visual methods.
- Extend the comparison through:
  - Spacing statistics and normalized distributions
  - Spectral autocorrelation
  - Random matrix theory (RMT) simulations
  - Pseudo-random modeling inspired by Terence Tao

## ðŸ§  Why It Matters

The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics. While a formal proof remains elusive, numerical and statistical comparisons offer insight into the structure and behavior of zeta zeros. This project contributes by:

- Providing a reproducible pipeline for spectral-zeta comparison
- Offering bilingual documentation for broader accessibility
- Integrating statistical modeling with operator theory
- Preparing outputs suitable for publication, outreach, and legacy

## ðŸ§© Structure Highlights

- Modular Python scripts for operator construction, eigenvalue computation, and statistical analysis
- CSV and PDF outputs for traceability and presentation
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
- Markdown documentation in English and Persian
