# FAQ — Spectral Operators and Zeta Zeros

This FAQ addresses common questions about the spectral operator project and its comparison with the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. For additional inquiries, feel free to open an issue or contact the author.

## ❓ What is the main goal of this project?

To construct a self-adjoint spectral operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions, compute its eigenvalues numerically, and compare them with the imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function — both numerically and statistically.

---

## ❓ Does this project prove the Riemann Hypothesis?

No. It does not offer a formal proof. Instead, it provides a reproducible framework for exploring structural similarities between spectral data and zeta zeros, which may inform future theoretical developments.

---

## ❓ What types of statistical analysis are included?

- Spacing statistics and normalized distributions  
- Spectral autocorrelation  
- Random matrix theory (RMT) simulations (GOE/GUE)  
- Pseudo-random modeling inspired by Terence Tao

---

## ❓ Are the results reproducible?

Yes. All code is modular and documented. Outputs are saved in CSV and PDF formats. You can reproduce the results by running `main.py` and the statistical modules.

---

## ❓ Is there documentation in Persian?

Yes. The file `docs/translation-fa.md` provides a full Persian-language summary of the project, including its goals, structure, and public outreach components.

---

## ❓ Can this project be used for educational purposes?

Absolutely. The modular codebase, documentation, and interactive notebooks are suitable for teaching spectral theory, numerical analysis, and statistical modeling — for students and researchers alike.

---

## ❓ Can the project be extended?

Yes. Possible extensions include:
- Analysis of L-functions and their zeros  
- Advanced statistical modeling  
- Spectral analysis in other functional spaces  
- Formal publication in peer-reviewed journals

## ❓ How do I run the project?

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
